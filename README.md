# SDG Website
Website for UN SDG Project 2022.


## Goal:
To create a website that allows anyone, especially someone with no STEM or political background, to find information about climate change and climate science in understandable, everyday terms. Links to primary sources of information/research/reports/policy/expert testimony to be directly linked and accessible for anyone who wants to see it. A primary source refers to a peer-reviewed journal article/video/report, or direct communication from a noted, credentialed expert in the field; it is not something from a general blog or popular/political/social media site, or an opinion piece. 

## The Why:
With too many people and policymakers not believing climate change is a real thing, we want to build a continuously growing, user-friendly site anyone can find both basic explanations of the science behind a climate issue of piece, as well as hyperlinks to primary science sources anyone can check, without being able to deny that “we just made up something” or that the information is not what they saw or heard from friends or politically slanted sources. WE WANT THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT TO BE CLEAR, and show others why scientists have NO QUESTION humans are the cause of present day climate change. We want the legitimate evidence, not interpretations or conspiracy theory based sources.
